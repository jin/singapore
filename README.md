Hi, welcome to Singapore!

This is a handbook for #rubyfriends from overseas
put together by members of the Singapore Ruby community.

## Meetups

RubySG meetups are held once a month, on a Tuesday.

For updates on the latest meetup, please check us out on [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Ruby-Group/).

## Data SIM Card

You can go into most convenience stores (eg. 7-11) and buy a pre-paid simcard
from either SingTel or StarHub (or possibly M1).

[SingTel plans](http://info.singtel.com/personal/phones-plans/mobile/singtel-prepaid)
and
[StarHub plans](http://www.starhub.com/personal/mobile/prepaid-plans.html).

You are very unlikely to find a nano format simcard however, which means you
should look for a phone store.

Looks like [this is the card](https://www.facebook.com/singtel/posts/10152525153311677)
to get for those who need nano sims.

## Power (Socket)

This [bad boy](http://www.iec.ch/worldplugs/typeG.htm) (Type G, BS 1363 UK, 230-240V).

Sometimes you can force the two prong [European Type C](http://www.iec.ch/worldplugs/typeC.htm)
into the socket, but it involves shoving a metal fork into the third hole, so I
tend to avoid using this one.

## Free WiFi

Changi Airport has it.

[Comment: Changi Airport is *amazing*. I returned from a trip one day and to
get from the gate, through customers and into a taxi took FOUR minutes.]

Wireless@SG is an open network available at almost every shopping mall, library and McDonalds'. 
Requires a log in. [Sign up here, under "Non-Singtel Customers"](http://info.singtel.com/personal/internet/broadband-on-the-go/wireless-sg). There is also a second network SSID called Wireless@SGx, which uses WPA-Enterprise + TKIP for authentication.

And the reboutable ladyironchef [lays down](http://www.ladyironchef.com/2013/08/cafes-free-wifi-singapore/)
where the free wifi cafes are.

## Tipping

No real need to tip. Leave a few coins if you'd like (to get rid of your coins).

You don't need to tip at a hawker food stall, and normal restaurants include a
10% service charge.

[Comment: Oh and talking about coins, Singapore is in a transition from one set
of coins to another differently sized set. So you'll get two sizes of each
coin. Yay!]

## Tissue Culture

Singaporeans often leave tissues on seats in busy food halls (hawker centres
etc.) while they walk around and buy food. I know you'll be tempted but best
not to remove the tissue and sit down.

[Comment: If you need your own tissues, hawker centres are the place to buy
them. You'll often find an older gentleman or lady offering one, two or more
packets for a dollar or two.]

## Communication

English mainly.
[Singlish](http://www.aussiepete.com/2008/05/singlish-language-guide-for-foreigners.html).

[Comment: You'll look like an idiot if you try this slang. I sometimes answer
"are you able to?" questions with "can!", but mostly that just makes me look
like an idiot. YMMV.]

## What to buy to bring back home

- Bak Kwa  
  For those who like their pork. Just walk into any
  [Bee Cheng Hiang](http://www.beechenghiang.com.sg/our-story/our-bakkwa.html)  
- Pandan Cake or Kueh Lapis from Bengawan Solo  
  Conveniently they have [outlets at Changi Airport](http://www.changiairport.com/shopping-and-dining/shopping/bengawan-solo).
- Pineapple cakes from [Sunny Hills](http://www.sunnyhills.com.sg/stores.php)

## Don'ts

- Vandalism
- Littering
- Chewing gum  
  [Comment: Actually you can chew gum like a cow chews cud, but you won't be
  able to buy any gum in Singapore and when you need to get rid of your gum,
  make sure you put it in a bin - see "littering" above.]

[Comment: You *really* don't want to commit even minor crimes here. Singapore
takes its law and order very seriously - one of the reasons it's a very nice
place to live.]

## Getting Around

Public transport in Singapore is excellent (see below) and probably should be
your first choice.

If you're in the central area you can certainly get to many places by walking
(but of course it's always hot and humid - and sometimes raining heavily - so
please take this into account).

### Taxi

- GrabTaxi
- Uber

Taxis could be a challenge during raining days.

### MRT and Buses

The public transport system runs on a reloadable contactless card called EZ-Link.

There are the [MRT trains](http://www.smrt.com.sg/Trains/NetworkMap.aspx) which
are frequent, clean and fast (and *full* of people during rush hour). (They run
underground in the central part of Singapore.)

There are the [buses](http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/) which go everywhere, and
are also very clean and comfortable.

Changi Airport has a MRT station at Terminal 2 and it takes about 45 min to get
into town. You take the train past expo which ends at Tanah Merah, then you
wait for a green line train *from* Pasir Ris *towards* Joo Koon. This then
takes you into the central area (probably City Hall or Raffles Place - don't go
all the way to Joo Koon!).

## Food

These are some of the local food that you should try if you are in Singapore.

[Comment: I've added photos for a few of the foods listed here, mostly the ones
I've tried in Singapore. If you're interested in some of the others, just grab
a staff member at RDRC for suggestions about where to find them.]

### Kaya Toast with Eggs

[Yakun](http://www.yakun.com.sg/) - these stores are everywhere. 

You can get this at the drink stall in almost every hawker center. Ask for "breakfast set".

### Nasi Lemak

This is a traditional Malays dish of chicken, rice and other nice things.

[Comment: Sorry, but I haven't found a really good Nasi Lemak in Singapore.]

### Carrot Cake

Go into any hawker centre and you'll find carrot cake. There are two varieties,
black and white.

### Popiah

A spicy roll and a great option for vegetarians.

![Popiah](/images/popiah.jpg)

### Chicken Rice

This is a very famous Singaporean dish.

Tian Tian in the Maxwell Food Centre is very famous (and I hear half decent).
If you like to stand in a long queue, please go there at lunch. If you don't go
there at lunch, they're unlikely to be open.

### Ice Kacang

A local dessert.

![Ais Bor](/images/ais_bor.jpg)

[Comment: Unfortunately Singapore just doesn't make good variations of this
dessert. You need to visit Malaysia for the real thing.]

### Tsui Kway / Chwee Kueh

This is an odd one, again from hawker centres. Rice cakes sprinkled with salted radish.

[Comment: I *think* it's vegetarian.]

### Laksa

Spicy noodle soup.

### Bak Kut Teh

Pork in a herb soup..

### Rojak

Rojak is a great local dish for vegetarians. Another staple of any food centre.

### Dim Sum

Not a traditional Singaporean dish but always a good option.

The most popular Hong Kong style dim sum (aka. yum cha) restaurant at the
moment is [Tim Ho Wan](http://www.timhowan.com/locate-us/) - their pork buns
are a "must try".

![Pork Buns](/images/tim_ho_wan_pork_buns.jpg)

### Kway Chap

[Um...google says...](https://www.google.com.sg/search?q=kway+chap+singapore&es_sm=91&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=rRiqU7e_CsmHuAS3yYGQBA&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1916&bih=986)

[Comment: I honestly don't know what this one is.]

### Chilli Crab

Singapore is very famous for its chilli crab.

If you can get there
[Mellben](https://www.facebook.com/MellbenSeafoodToaPayoh) is quite good. Try
their Crab Bee Hoon.]

[Comment: Don't try this at touristy restaurants - it's just not worth it.]

### Wanton Noodles

Again, not a truly local dish, but a very nice Chinese dish of noodles and
pork.

Worth visiting [Foong Kee Coffee Shop](http://www.hungrygowhere.com/singapore/foong_kee/)
if you're in Chinatown.

![Wanton Min](/images/wanton_min.jpg)

## Drinking Locations

- Club Street
- Clarke Quay  
  [Comment: If you like local beers, [The Pump Room](http://www.pumproomasia.com/)
  at Clarke Quay is worth visiting to try their ales.]

Of course there will be many other places that people drink in Singapore, just
ask someone at RDRC for recommendations.

### Singapore Sling

This is an alcoholic drink. I've never tried it but I'm sure it has a lot of
booze in it.

The quintessential place to drink it is at Raffles Hotel (in the public area),
but very expensive.
